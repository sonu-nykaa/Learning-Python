# In Python, a string is a sequence of characters. For example, "hello" is a string containing a sequence of
# characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o'.
# We use single quotes or double quotes to represent a string in Python. For example,

print('I am loving PrepInsta Prime Video Course for Python')
print("It starts from Basics")
print('I "personally" am loving it a lot')
print("It's easy to include 'single quotes' also")

# create a string using double quotes
str = "My name is "
# name = "Sonu
# Taking input from user
name = input("Enter your name : ")
print(str + name)
